# ioBroker.build

Windows installer Build installation packages for ioBroker.

Pre-requires:

- Node.js with NPM
- Windows to build .exe
- Internet connection, because the `nodejs` will be downloaded by gulp.

#Build on windows:

1. download and extract to some directory: https://github.com/ioBroker/ioBroker.build/archive/master.zip, e.g. to `d:\ioBroker.build`

2. Start the console (cmd.exe) and go to `d:\ioBroker.build`:

```
   >d:
   >cd ioBroker.build
```

3. Install gulp-cli:

```
   >npm install
```

4. Call gulp. It will take a while:

```
   >npm run build
```

6. The result will be stored in `d:\ioBroker.build\delivery` as `ioBrokerInstaller.VX.y.z.exe`
